### Hi there! This is Bingjie Zeng.
##### Welcome and have a nice day!

I am currently a student at University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB) and a special auditor at Hokkaido University (HU).

My research interests are quantitative linguistics, historical linguistics, and computational linguistics. Specifically speaking, my current study focuses on extracting the quantitative historical features of Chinese and tries to probe their application in other fields. e.g. language education and natural language processing.
